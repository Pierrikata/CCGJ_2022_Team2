# CCGJ_2022_Team2
a template for our main project

Already setup so far:
-the core movement mechanics of our player controller
-Enemy Locomotion and death animation

To Do List:
-NPC controller
  ~make the enemy NPC follow the player
  ~make an NPC attack the player
  ~make NPCs spawn in a new level
-create a level map (could use tile palettes or assets from itch.io)
-create a main menu and level transitions (game over screen will be optional if player can respawn)
